# VoxelEdit-Blender
a prototype of a voxel editing addon for blender

This adds a new tool in the edit mode and allows the user to add and remove voxels(cubes).

**Features:**
- add a Voxel with the left mouse button
- remove a Voxel with the right mouse button
- select active vertex group by pressing "G"

This is a prototype and only works with 2x2x2 cubes.
